		I study how the design of digital and physical environments changes the way people eat and exercise. I also study topics like how to do statistics better and how to reduce animal cruelty. I publish my findings for free on my blog <a target="_blank"  href="https://designbetter.substack.com/">Design Better</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some questions that spark my curiosity: 	
		<ul>
			<li>How do we make eating healthy not a horrible, unsustainable experience? </li>
			<li>How do we make exercise a daily routine?</li>
			<li>How do we do statistics better?</li>
			<li>How do we reduce the number of dogs put down and abused?</li>
		</ul>
