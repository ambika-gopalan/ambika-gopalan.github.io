I study how design changes the way people exercise. I also study how to do causal inference better and how to reduce animal suffering. I publish my findings for free on my blog *[Design Better](https://designbetter.substack.com/){:target="_blank"}*.

Some questions that spark my curiosity:
* How do we make exercise a daily routine?
* How do we do causal inference better?
* How do we reduce the number of dogs put down and abused?
