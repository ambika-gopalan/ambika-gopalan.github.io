I study how the design of digital and physical environments changes the way people eat and exercise. I also study topics like how to do statistics better and how to reduce animal cruelty. I publish my findings for free on my blog <a href="https://designbetter.substack.com/"><i>Design Better</i></a>.

Some questions that spark my curiosity:
* How do we make eating healthy not a horrible, unsustainable experience?
* How do we make exercise a daily routine?
* How do we do statistics better?
* How do we reduce the number of dogs put down and abused?
